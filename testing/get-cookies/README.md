# Example for getting LMS cookies:

To run:

```
node index.js

Input your username, password and a valid duo OTP (6 digit code, cannot be push because I didn't implement that)
```

Will print out cookies. Make sure to set your chrome executable path and whether you want `headless` mode in `index.js`.
